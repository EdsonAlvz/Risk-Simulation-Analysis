# Risk-Simulation-Analysis: Monte Carlo, Markov Chains, and Queueing Theory in Insurance Risk

---

## Overview

This project provides an integrated framework for **financial risk assessment** in the insurance sector by combining **Monte Carlo simulations**, **Queueing Theory**, **Markov Chains**, and **distribution fitting**. It evaluates an insurer's potential for **financial ruin** over a finite horizon, modeling claims dynamics and their financial impact.

The model captures key risk factors:
- **Claim frequency and severity**, modeled via **Poisson processes** and **exponential or log-normal distributions**.
- **Markov chains** for state transitions between different claim severity levels.
- **Queueing systems (M/M/1)** to evaluate operational efficiency.
- **Monte Carlo simulations** to analyze capital trajectories, estimate ruin probabilities, and perform sensitivity analysis.

This comprehensive approach allows insurers to simulate real-world scenarios and optimize financial strategies to mitigate risks.

## Mathematical Concepts Employed

- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Random sampling methods to estimate risk measures (e.g., **Value at Risk**).
- **Poisson Processes**: Models the frequency of insurance claims.
- **Exponential and Log-Normal Distributions**: Fit claim severities and interarrival times.
- **Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test**: Evaluates the goodness-of-fit of statistical distributions.
- **Markov Chains**: Describes transitions between discrete claim severity states, computes **stationary probabilities**.
- **Queueing Theory (M/M/1 model)**: Assesses system capacity, **server utilization** ($\rho$), **waiting times**, and **queue lengths**.
- **Optimization Decision Criteria**: Uses **maximin**, **maximax**, and **expected value** decision rules for evaluating claims settlement strategies.
- **Distribution Fitting and Sensitivity Analysis**: Determines the optimal distribution for claims and analyzes the impact of varying premiums and capital levels on ruin probabilities.

## Functional Components

1. **Monte Carlo Simulation for Financial Ruin**
   - Simulates the insurer's capital evolution over time.
   - Models **claim occurrences** as a **Poisson process** and **claim amounts** via fitted distributions (e.g., log-normal).
   - Calculates **ruin probabilities** and **time-to-ruin** under varying initial capitals and premium levels.

2. **Distribution Fitting and Validation**
   - Fits claim data to multiple distributions (**gamma**, **exponential**, **normal**, **log-normal**, **weibull**).
   - Employs the **Kolmogorov-Smirnov test** for distribution selection.
   - Applies **outlier removal** techniques (IQR-based) to improve fit quality.

3. **Markov Chain Modeling for Claim Dynamics**
   - Processes historical claims data.
   - Defines discrete **claim severity states** (Low, Moderate, High, Very High).
   - Constructs **transition matrices** and solves for **stationary distributions**.
   - Simulates capital trajectories over time based on state transitions.

4. **Queueing Theory for Operational Risk**
   - Implements **M/M/1 queue simulations** to evaluate the insurer's capacity to process claims.
   - Analyzes metrics such as **average waiting times**, **server utilization rates**, and **queue lengths**.
   - Explores the effect of varying **service rates (\mu)** relative to **arrival rates (\lambda)**.

5. **Decision Analysis for Claims Settlement**
   - Builds **payoff matrices** across claim severity levels and settlement options (Deny, Settle, Approve in Full).
   - Applies decision-making criteria (**maximin**, **maximax**, **expected value**) to identify optimal settlement strategies.
